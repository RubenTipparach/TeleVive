	\begin{abstract}
	The age of virtual reality as mainstream media has finally dawned. With it, consumers everywhere are looking for innovations in immersive worlds, next-gen video games, and advanced human-computer interfaces. This proposal will study the viability of a data processing architecture using inexpensive Raspberry Pi's to construct a photogrammetric array to scan objects, places, and people into a virtual world. The experiment will consist of blending together still models and fully animated 3D models all displayed within a virtual environment as a holographic representation.
